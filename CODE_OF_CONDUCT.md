# Code of Conduct

## 1. Introduction
The Code of Conduct was made for the purpose of safe-guarding
our community and contributors. It is to outline what is and
what is not acceptable, and the consequences that result of
any bad actions. It will give the anomynous protection to
people who report and whistleblow to anyone who has broken
this code of conduct.

## 2. Scope of Conduct
The Code of Conduct applies across all of GitHub, including
all repos which are related to Project International. Even 
if the repo does not contain this code of conduct, it will
still be enforced if related to Project International. The 
Code of Conduct will also apply to Google Drive, Forms, 
Sheets, Docs and Slides, or any other software used by
Project International. Other software can include any form
of communications. These violations do not in any way have
to be relate to Project International, as the community
should be a safe, non-toxic environment.

## 3. Whistleblowing
We encourage everyone to remain anomynous when reporting
a person, and we will assist in keeping you and your 
report anomynous as to not get you or anyone involved any
sort of hate. All whistelblowers and reporters are given
full anomynous rights when reporting, and shall only be
revealed if they do so themselves. If you are caught 
leaking the identities or reporters, expect a extremely
severe ban. You will still be banned for doing this, even
if it is a joke or the person you leaked was the wrong
person.
