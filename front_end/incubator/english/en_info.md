# English Dictionary
The English front end website should be the first one to be made. This is due to the vasts amount of English dictionaries, English dictionary APis and the hundreds of wordslists available for use. It is also due to the fact that GitHub supports English directly and uses fonts to display English, however, languages with special symbols may be performance heavy or not properly displayed.

Anything on the English Dictionary should be English, inter-translation pages can be made in another language. The main website will display the English Dictionaries first, and documents should be made in English.
